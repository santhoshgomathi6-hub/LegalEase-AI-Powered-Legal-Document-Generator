# PHASE 2 – REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS

## Project Title

LegalEaseAI – AI-Powered Legal Document Generator

## 1. Introduction

Requirement analysis identifies the functional and technical requirements needed to develop the LegalEaseAI application.

LegalEaseAI is designed to generate customizable legal document drafts using Generative AI based on information provided by the user.

## 2. Problem Statement

Creating legal documents manually can be time-consuming and difficult for users who do not have legal knowledge.

### 3.2 User Input

The system should collect:

- Document type
- Parties involved
- Terms and conditions
- Effective date
- Additional requirements

### 3.3 Input Validation

The system should check whether the required fields have been entered before generating the document.

### 3.4 AI Document Generation

The system should send the user requirements to the selected Generative AI model and generate a structured legal document draft.

### 3.5 Result Display

The generated document should be displayed on a result page so that the user can review the content.

6. Download/save option

## 6. AI Requirements

The application should integrate a Generative AI model/API.

The user's information should be converted into a suitable prompt.

The AI model should generate a structured legal document based on the provided information.

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements
